# Florians little _How to code_

pull request are highly appreciated, but this Repo should only contain the most important things :smile:

- All of these tipps should used with common sense, they are not rules - they should help you write even more readable code

1. Never make functions or methods bigger than 40 lines of code.
1. Give functions and classes matching names - nobody cares if the function name is long (in a common sense).
1. Continue should only be used in loops (But there is LINQ which can solve your problem - even more readable).
1. Every function can be a implemented as a class. Determine if this is the better option.
1. *NEVER EVER* let commented code in productive environment!
1. Write unit tests before you implement the actual code - it ensures that the code you write will meet your expectations
